The left wrist moves to position a spherical object, likely part of its arm assembly.\n  2. The object is brought closer to another item on the conveyor belt.\n  3. The object is lowered or brought in front of the scanning item.\n\n- **Right Arm Motion:**\n  1. The right wrist moves to assist in picking up or moving the object.\n  2. The robot shifts its position to handle or interact with the item on the conveyor.\n  3. The object is positioned or moved in preparation for scanning or placement into a basket.\n\n### Detailed Motion Explanations\n\n1. **Left Wrist Motion:**\n   - The left wrist adjusts the position of a spherical object (likely a sensor or component) to align it correctly for scanning or picking up an item.\n   - It pans or adjusts its position slightly to ensure visibility for the scanning process.\n\n2. **Right Wrist Motion:**\n   - The right wrist facilitates movement, possibly lifting or manipulating the object to bring it forward for scanning or placing.\n   - It tracks the object's position, adjusting to align it correctly within the robotic path.\n\nOverall, the right arm assists in moving and stabilizing the object for the intended actions\u2014scanning or placing items into the basket.
